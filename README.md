## mozaik-tools
Various tools including useful bootstrapping  setups that CSNG developed along with mozaik but that do not fit into the core mozaik distribution.

Each tool is contained in its own subdirectory, with its own README. 

### A list of tools with brief description follows:

**TestStimuli** - a simple economic mozaik simulaton setup, where you insert your stimulation experiment (expriments.py) and will receive a video of the stimulus actually presented on the retina.

**Optimization** - tool for running mozaik model in optimization setup, i.e. runs series of jobs with a list of *targets* and finds the parameters that provide the best fit.
